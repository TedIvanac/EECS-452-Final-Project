# EECS-452-Final-Project

Developed by Servando Garza, Matthew Perez, and Edward (Ted) Ivanac

Using a Pi Cam, we will capture black lines we draw on a piece of grid paper as our control signal, and our microprocessor would analyze those lines and translate them into directions for the car to move in. We'll also strap a camera on our robot for live feedback. The goal of this project is to use drawing to control our robot car instead of a controller.
